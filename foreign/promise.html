		  		<h2>CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY</h2>
		  		<h3>Success, But Not at Any Price</h3>
		  		<p class="p1">At P/Kaufmann Contract we believe that corporate and environmental responsibility are inextricably linked. Over the past three decades we have worked to develop culture and initiatives that protect the environment and enhance our community.</p>

		  	<h2>Mindful Material Sourcing</h2>
            <p>When sourcing dyes for our printed and woven fabrics, we seek out suppliers with robust environmental strategies. Our major domestic print source utilizes water-based rather than chemical-based inks, and recently installed an in-house water filtration system to ensure that clean, filtered water is returned to the community. They also use recycled water throughout the manufacturing process and use heat transfer printing paper that is Forest Stewardship Council certified. After it has been used for printing our fabrics, the paper is recycled to eliminate waste.</p>
